## Overview

This repository explores foundational techniques in statistical model fitting and classification, with a focus on both continuous and discrete data. Implemented exercises emphasize parameter estimation, data preparation, and evaluation of standard classifiers.

* Applied QDA, LDA, Gaussian Naive Bayes, k-NN and Bag of words using `scikit-learn`.
* Evaluated classification accuracy.
* Compared results using a bar chart.

## Objectives

* Apply Gaussian model fitting to real-world data.
* Prepare and vectorize text data for classification.
* Implement and evaluate classifiers using scikit-learn.
* Visualize model performance for comparative analysis.

* This notebook represents my implemented solutions for the exercises detailed above.
